      To get started:
        kubepyrometer init           # generate a config file in the current directory
        kubepyrometer run            # run with default settings
        kubepyrometer run -p large   # run with the 'large' cluster profile

      Run output is saved to ./runs/<timestamp>/ by default.
      See kubepyrometer help for all commands.
